# Video Processing with Google Cloud Platform

This project implements a distributed video processing pipeline using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, including Pub/Sub, Firestore, and Cloud Storage. It features a Flask-based web interface, master-worker architecture for task orchestration, and automated resource setup.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. **Google Cloud SDK**: Install and authenticate using:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>
   ```
3. **Service Account Key**: Set up authentication:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/service-account-key.json"
   ```
4. **Install Required Python Libraries**:
   Each folder (`app`, `master`, `worker`) contains a `requirements.txt` file. Install dependencies as required.

---

## How to Run

### 1. Set Up Google Cloud Resources
Run the `setup_resources.py` script to create Cloud Storage buckets, Pub/Sub topics, and Firestore collections:
```bash
cd cloud_setup
python3 setup_resources.py
```

### 2. Deploy Master and Worker Nodes
Use the deployment scripts to set up the master and worker nodes:
```bash
./deploy_master.sh
./deploy_worker.sh
```

### 3. Run the Flask Application
Start the Flask app for user interaction:
```bash
cd app
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```
Access the app at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 4. Master Node Workflow
The `master.py` script orchestrates the video processing tasks:
```bash
cd master
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 master.py
```

### 5. Worker Nodes
Worker nodes handle the processing of video chunks:
```bash
cd worker
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 worker.py
```

## Key Features

- **Distributed Video Processing**: Splits large videos into chunks, processes them in parallel, and generates summaries.
- **Google Cloud Integration**: Utilizes Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, and Firestore for scalable resource management.
- **Web Interface**: Simple and intuitive Flask-based web application for user interaction.
- **Automated Deployment**: Scripts for setting up and deploying GCP resources and services.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Configurations**: Update project-specific configurations in the scripts:
  - `project_id`
  - `bucket_name`
  - `topic_id`
  - `subscription_id`
- **Logs**: Check for logs to debug issues. Logs are printed to the console during execution.
- **Scalability**: Add more worker nodes as needed by deploying additional instances with `deploy_worker.sh`.
